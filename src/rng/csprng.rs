//! ChaCha20-based CSPRNG
//!
//! This module implements a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number
//! generator (CSPRNG) built on top of the ChaCha20 block function.
//!
//! It is designed as a low-level primitive for the Nebula ecosystem and:
//! - relies on the operating system for initial entropy
//! - uses ChaCha20 as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG)
//! - avoids heap allocations
//! - provides forward secrecy via periodic rekeying
//!
//! This CSPRNG is suitable for key generation, nonces, identifiers,
//! and other security-critical randomness needs. It is **not** intended
//! to replace a full-featured, externally audited RNG library, but to
//! serve as a predictable and auditable internal primitive.

/// Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
///
/// The generator is initialized from OS-provided entropy and then expands
/// randomness using the ChaCha20 block function in a deterministic manner.
///
/// Internally, it maintains:
/// - a 256-bit secret key (`U256`)
/// - a 96-bit nonce (fixed to zero for DRBG usage)
/// - a 32-bit block counter
///
/// After generating output, the generator rekeys itself to provide forward
/// secrecy: compromise of the current internal state does not allow recovery
/// of previously generated output.
